    <h5><strong>Participation in the second phase</strong></h5>
    
    There are 2 phases in this study with different tasks and rewards. Participation is voluntary, you can withdraw at any time, and you will be compensated for your time in accordance to which phase you have completed.

        <ul>
        <li>📘 <strong>Phase 1</strong> – Training & Initial Survey, <b>6-7 minutes</b>, <b>0.40 GBP / 0.54 USD</b></li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Phase 2</strong> – Group Interaction, <b>max. 13 minutes</b>, <b>an additional 3.10 GBP / 4.18 USD</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>⌛️ <strong>Phase 2</strong> requires a <strong>live interaction</strong> with other participants, so we will require you to wait until you will be matched with other participants (max. 20 minutes). If we are unable to match you with a group, you will receive a total of <strong>1.50 GBP / 2.01 USD</strong> as compensation for your<strong> waiting time.</strong></p>


    You can only participate in the second phase <b>if you complete this survey</b> and <b>meet the eligibility criteria</b>. You will still be compensated <b>0.40 GBP / 0.54 USD</b> for your time if we find you ineligible to participate in the second phase. The second phase will be around 20 minutes long and you will be compensated <b>3.10 GBP / 4.18 USD</b> for your time in addition to the first phase payment.
