    <h5>Tip: A Call for Independent Thinking</h5>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold">
        Some people might not be comfortable speaking about their true opinion. 
        In order to arrive at the best decision possible, it's necessary for someone 
        to choose an opinion that is different from others to empower the minority 
        opinion to speak up. We have chosen you to do this task. Try not to conform and choose something that is different from the others. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes the majority gets it wrong — trust your judgment.</li>
        <li>You don’t have to agree just because others do. Think for yourself.</li>
        <li>Being in the minority doesn’t mean you're wrong — it often means you're ahead.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h5>Tip: Reflections from Your Peers</h5>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold">
        In a situation where it's not obvious which solution is the best, people often 
        look at others to help decide. Therefore, we will show you what others have chosen 
        in this scenario. You can look at their answers and see which one is the majority 
        to help guide your decision. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many others have already considered this carefully — you might find their reasoning helpful.</li>
        <li>This perspective has resonated with a lot of people in similar situations.</li>
        <li>Others have found this option to reflect shared values and priorities.</li>
