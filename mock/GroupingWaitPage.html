    <div class="custom-title">🕒 Waiting for a Group to Form</div>

    <p>Thank you for completing Phases 1 and 2! Imagine that you are now waiting to be placed into a group with other participants for the interactive round (Phase 3).</p>

    <p>🚶‍➡️🚶🏻 In this next phase, imagine that you <strong>run into some neighbors by chance</strong>—you're out for a walk and strike up a brief chat. You get to <strong>talk about a dilemma that’s up for discussion</strong> in the upcoming community meeting. </p>
    
    <p>Together, you’ll <strong>share your opinion about the same dilemma</strong> and get to hear each other’s perspectives.</p>
    <p>📅 The next community meeting is scheduled for next week and <strong>you have to make up your mind about what to say</strong> so your community can decide on what to do. </p>    
    
    <hr>

    <h3>💰 Compensation</h3>

    If you are successfully placed in a group with other neighbors and <strong>complete the discussion rounds</strong>, you will receive a <strong>bonus payment</strong> on top of your base payment.


    <p>We appreciate your patience and your commitment to participating fully. This phase is essential to the study, and your involvement makes it possible.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Thank you for staying with us!</strong></p>
