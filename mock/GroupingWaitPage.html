    <div class="custom-title">🕒 Waiting for a Group to Form</div>

    <p>Thank you for completing Phases 1 and 2! You are now waiting to be placed into a group with other participants for the interactive round (Phase 3).</p>
    <img src="/static/neighbors-new.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Meeting Neighbors Image" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px; max-width: 100%; height: 240px; "> 
    <p>🚶‍➡️🚶🏻 In this next phase, imagine that you <strong>run into some neighbors by chance</strong>—you're out for a walk and strike up a brief chat. You get to <strong>talk about a dilemma that’s up for discussion</strong> in the upcoming community meeting. </p>
    
    <p>Together, you’ll <strong>share your opinion about the same dilemma</strong> and get to hear each other’s perspectives.</p>
    <p>📅 The next community meeting is scheduled for next week and <strong>you have to make up your mind about what to say</strong> so your community can decide on what to do. </p>

    <h3>🔔 Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This part of the study involves <strong>real-time interaction</strong> with others.</li>
        <li>Once you join the group discussion, you must:
            <ul>
                <li>Stay at your <strong>computer</strong> at all times.</li>
                <li>Be <strong>actively attentive</strong> and ready to respond.</li>
                <li>Remain connected until the discussion ends.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may need to <strong>wait up to <span style="color: red;">10 minutes</span></strong> while we form your group.</li>
        <li><strong>Please do not leave your screen</strong> during this time.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>💰 Compensation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are successfully placed in a group with other neighbors and <strong>complete the discussion rounds</strong>, you will receive a <strong>bonus payment</strong> on top of your base payment.</li>
        <li>If a group <strong>cannot be formed</strong> within the allowed time, you will still receive <strong>compensation</strong> for your time and effort.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We appreciate your patience and your commitment to participating fully. This phase is essential to the study, and your involvement makes it possible.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Thank you for staying with us!</strong></p>
