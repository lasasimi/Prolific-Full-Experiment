        Imagine that you live in a village of around 50 houses owned by neighbors of different ages, occupations, and incomes. 
        The village has many shared facilities, such as the children's playground, the community garden, garbage collection area, community halls, and so on. 
        All neighbors meet as a community once every six months to discuss issues regarding maintenance and neighborhood problems.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will now show you a series of dilemmas experienced by your village. After each dilemma, we will ask you a few questions about each of them. 
    First, as you are a part of the village, we will ask what you think the community should do. You will be given several options to choose from. 
    Then, we will ask you other questions about some further aspects of the dilemmas.
