    In the next phase, you will read a series of dilemmas encountered by your village. After each dilemma, you will be asked a set of questions. Before we begin, we will show you the neighborhood situation again to help you recall the context. 
    <p class="green-box">✅ You must complete this phase, along with Phase 1, to receive the base payment.</p>

    <p>🏘️ Imagine that <strong>you live in a village of around 50 houses owned by neighbors</strong> of different ages, occupations, and incomes. </p>
    <p>👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 The village has <strong>many shared facilities</strong> and sometimes issues arise about what to do collectively about these facilities. </p>
    <p>🏡 There are often different opinions on how to handle these issues. <strong>All neighbors meet as a community once every six months to make a decision</strong> about the neighborhood problems. </p>
    
    <p>💭 We’d like to hear <strong>your initial opinions on the dilemmas</strong> your neighborhood is facing, which will be introduced on the next screen.</p>
