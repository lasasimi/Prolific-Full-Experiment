      One of the neighbors recently lost their cat. The cat is old and is usually staying inside the house. One neighbor mentions that the cat was roaming around the neighborhood two days ago. Some neighbors propose to help search for the cat near the sewage in case it was trapped. However, some are against helping the search because they saw the cat was alright, it was just roaming around the garden with other strays. Other neighbors want to first verify if the cat in the garden is indeed the lost cat.
