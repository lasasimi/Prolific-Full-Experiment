        <p>We would like to invite you to participate in a research study conducted by the researchers from the Wrocław University of Science and Technology and the Complexity Science Hub Vienna about how people form opinions. Please read the information below and ask any questions you may have before deciding whether or not to participate.</p>  
        
        <p><strong>💰 Total possible payment: 3.50 GBP</strong></p>

        There are 2 phases in this study with different tasks and rewards. Participation is voluntary, you can withdraw at any time, and you will be compensated for your time in accordance to which phase you have completed.

        <ul>
        <li>📘 <strong>Phase 1</strong> – Training & Initial Survey, <b>6-7 minutes</b>, <b>0.40 GBP</b></li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Phase 2</strong> – Group Interaction, <b>max. 13 minutes</b>, <b>an additional 3.10 GBP</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>⌛️ <strong>Phase 2</strong> requires a <strong>live interaction</strong> with other participants, so in between Phase 1 and 2, we will require you to wait until you will be matched with other participants (max. 20 minutes). If we are unable to match you with a group, you will receive a total of <strong>2.50 GBP</strong> as compensation for your<strong> waiting time.</strong></p>

        <strong>What is the purpose of this study?</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how people form opinions in groups. Results from this study will help us understand collective phenomena such as polarization and consensus.
            You have been invited to participate in this study because you are at least 18 years of age.</p>
        <strong>What is the procedure of the study?</strong>
            <p>You will be participating in an online research experiment involving personal opinions and group interaction. The study consists of three phases:
                <br>
            📘 Phase 1 – Training & Initial Survey, 6-7 minutes. You will first go through a training session to understand the task, followed by a comprehension quiz to ensure everything is clear. You will be asked to read a dilemma that a community encounter and indicate your opinion. This will be done individually.
            <br>
            💬 Phase 2 – Group Interaction, max. 13 minutes. Only if you pass the first phase, you will be able to participate in a group interaction about one of the dilemmas with other participants. Initially, you may need to wait up to 20 minutes for a group to form. There will then be several short rounds of interaction, each with a new subset of participants. In each round, you’ll see what these people think about the dilemma.
            </p>
        <strong>What are the benefits of participating in the study?</strong>
        <p>Your participation will help us understand how people form opinions in groups. You will also be compensated for the duration of the study according to standard hourly rates.</p>
        
        <strong>What are the possible risks for taking in this study? Could participants experience any discomfort or other side effects?</strong>
        <p>There are no foreseeable risks and we expect no discomfort, or any other side effects, from your participation in the study.</p> 

        <strong>Does participating in the study have any other effects on participants’ lifestyle? What are the obligations resulting from participating?</strong>
        <p>Study participation is not expected to have any other impacts on your lifestyle. There are no future obligations associated with participating in the study. </p>
        
        <strong>What should participants do if they experience symptoms of complaints, unwanted side effects and/or injuries?</strong>
        <p>If you have any negative experiences during the study, please contact the study coordinators Katarzyna Weron at Politechnika Wrocławska or Gabriela Juncosa at Complexity Science Hub Vienna, who you can contact at <a href="mailto:collectivemindslab@csh.ac.at">collectivemindslab@csh.ac.at</a>. </p>
        
        <strong>In what cases is it necessary that participants withdraw from the study early?</strong>

        <strong>How will the data collected in this study be used?</strong>
        <p>The personal data collected from you is the minimum relevant to the scope of the present study, and it will only be used for the specific, explicit and legitimate purposes for which they are obtained. Data on your actions during your participation will also be collected and used for research purposes. Once your data has been fully anonymized and cannot be linked back to you in any way, it will be analyzed and placed in an Open Data Repository to be shared with other researchers. 
            This will be done solely for research purposes and not for commercial use, in compliance with EU policy. Aggregated data may be shared to support reproducibility of published results. Personal data will not be used for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which the data were collected. Personal data will be stored on our servers until you lodge an objection or withdraw your consent. The data will not be transferred outside the EU. The personal data collected is not subject to automated decision-making, and not subject to profiling.</p>
        
        <strong>What are your rights regarding the processing of your personal data? </strong>
        <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your data for marketing purposes or purposes related to conducting quality and satisfaction surveys – as we are processing your data on the basis of legitimate interest; the right to object to the processing of your data on grounds of special circumstances – in cases where we process your data on the basis of our legitimate interest for purposes other than those set out in the item above, the right to request that your personal data be rectified; the right to request the erasure of your personal data, only if we are not obliged by law to process it, the rights to request that the processing of your personal data should be restricted; the right to have your data transferred, i.e. the right to receive your personal data from us – in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable computer format. You may transfer this data to another data controller on your own or request that we transfer your data to another controller. 
        However, we will only do this if such a transfer is feasible. Finally, you have the right to access your personal data. In order to exercise these rights, please contact the study coordinators at <a href="mailto:collectivemindslab@csh.ac.at">collectivemindslab@csh.ac.at</a>. </p>
        
        <strong>Will there be any costs for the participants? Will they receive reimbursement or remuneration? </strong>
        <p>There is no cost for taking part in the study. The study consists of three phases, where the first two 
            are completed individually, with no interaction with others. You will be compensated for the duration of the study 
            according to the standard hourly rate. You will receive a base payment of 1.00 USD only if you fully complete Phase 1. We will pay you an additional bonus of 3.00 USD if you agree to participate in the group interaction (Phase 2), and remain active by not leaving the browser tab for the entire duration of the activity. If a group cannot be formed, you will still be compensated with a base payment of 1.00 USD and an additional 1.00 USD for a total of 2.00 USD. If you become inactive during the interaction, you will not receive any payment.</p>
        <strong>Possibility to discuss further questions </strong>
