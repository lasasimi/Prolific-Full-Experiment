        <p>We would like to invite you to participate in a research study conducted by the researchers from the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology and the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. Please read the information below and ask any questions you may have before deciding whether or not to participate.  </p>  
        You are invited to participate in a research study about how people form opinions in groups. There are 3 phases in this study with different tasks and rewards. Participation is voluntary, you can withdraw at any time, and you will be compensated for your time in accordance to which phase you have completed. 
        <ul>
            <li>üìò <strong>Phase 1</strong> ‚Äì Training & Comprehension, <b>2 minutes</b></li>
            <li>üó≥Ô∏è <strong>Phase 2</strong> ‚Äì Survey, <b>5 minutes</b>, <b>$1.00</b></li>

        <strong>What is the purpose of this study?</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how people form opinions in groups. Results from this study will help us understand collective phenomena such as polarization and consensus.
            You have been invited to participate in this study because you are at least 18 years of age.</p>
        <strong>What is the procedure of the study?</strong>
            <p>You will be participating in an online research experiment involving personal opinions and group discussions. The study consists of three phases:
                <br>
            üìò Phase 1 ‚Äì Training & Comprehension, 2 minutes. You will first go through a training session to understand the task, followed by a comprehension quiz to ensure everything is clear.
            <br>
            üó≥Ô∏è Phase 2 ‚Äì Survey, 5 minutes. You will be asked to read four dilemmas that a community might encounter regarding different social or political issues, and indicate your opinion about each. These first two phases are completed individually, with no interaction with others.
            <br>
            üí¨ Phase 3 ‚Äì Group Discussions, max. 5 minutes. If you pass the comprehension quiz and complete the opinion questions, you will be able to participate in a group discussion about one of the dilemmas with 9 other participants. Initially, you may need to wait up to 10 minutes for a group to form. There will then be several short rounds of discussion, each with a new subset of 4 other participants. In each round, you‚Äôll see what these people think about the dilemma.
            </p>
        <strong>What are the benefits of participating in the study?</strong>
