        <strong>How will the data collected in this study be used?</strong>
        <p>The personal data collected from you is the minimum relevant to the scope of the present study, and it will only be used for the specific, explicit and legitimate purposes for which they are obtained. Data on your actions during your participation will also be collected and used for research purposes. Once your data has been fully anonymized and cannot be linked back to you in any way, it will be analyzed and placed in an Open Data Repository to be shared with other researchers. 
            This will be done solely for research purposes and not for commercial use, in compliance with EU policy. Aggregated data may be shared to support reproducibility of published results. Personal data will not be used for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which the data were collected. Personal data will be stored on our servers until you lodge an objection or withdraw your consent. The data will not be transferred outside the EU. The personal data collected is not subject to automated decision-making, and not subject to profiling.</p>
        
        <strong>What are your rights regarding the processing of your personal data? </strong>
        <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your data for marketing purposes or purposes related to conducting quality and satisfaction surveys – as we are processing your data on the basis of legitimate interest; the right to object to the processing of your data on grounds of special circumstances – in cases where we process your data on the basis of our legitimate interest for purposes other than those set out in the item above, the right to request that your personal data be rectified; the right to request the erasure of your personal data, only if we are not obliged by law to process it, the rights to request that the processing of your personal data should be restricted; the right to have your data transferred, i.e. the right to receive your personal data from us – in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable computer format. You may transfer this data to another data controller on your own or request that we transfer your data to another controller. 
        However, we will only do this if such a transfer is feasible. Finally, you have the right to access your personal data. In order to exercise these rights, please contact the study coordinator Dr. Gabriela Juncosa at <a href="mailto:juncosa@csh.ac.at">juncosa@csh.ac.at</a>. </p>
        
        <strong>Will there be any costs for the participants? Will they receive reimbursement or remuneration? </strong>
        <p>There is no cost for taking part in the study. You will be compensated for the duration of the study 
            according to the standard hourly rate. The study consists of three phases, where the first two 
            are completed individually, with no interaction with others. You will receive a base payment of USD 1.40 
            only if you fully complete both Phase 1 and Phase 2. An additional bonus is available if you if you agree to 
            participate in a group discussion (Phase 3). </p>
        <strong>Possibility to discuss further questions </strong>
        <p>If you have any further questions about the study, or about your rights as a participant, we encourage you to contact the study coordinator Dr. Gabriela Juncosa at <a href="mailto:juncosa@csh.ac.at">juncosa@csh.ac.at</a>. </p>
