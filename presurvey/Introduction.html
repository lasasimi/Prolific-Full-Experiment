        <strong>What is the purpose of this study?</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how people form opinions in groups. Results from this study will help us understand collective phenomena such as polarization and consensus.
            You have been invited to participate in this study because you are at least 18 years of age.</p>
        <strong>What is the procedure of the study?</strong>
            <p>You will be participating in an online research experiment involving personal opinions and group discussions. The study consists of three phases:
                <br>
            📘 Phase 1 – Training & Comprehension, 2 minutes. You will first go through a training session to understand the task, followed by a comprehension quiz to ensure everything is clear.
            <br>
            🗳️ Phase 2 – Survey, 3 minutes. You will be asked to read four dilemmas that a community might encounter regarding different social or political issues, and indicate your opinion about each. These first two phases are completed individually, with no interaction with others.
            <br>
            💬 Phase 3 – Group Discussions, 5 minutes. If you pass the comprehension quiz and complete the opinion questions, you will imagine participating in a group discussion about one of the dilemmas with other participants. You may need to wait in between pages to load. There will then be several short rounds of discussion, each with a new subset of other participants. In each round, you’ll see what these people think about the dilemma.
            </p>
        <strong>What are the benefits of participating in the study?</strong>

        <strong>Does participating in the study have any other effects on participants’ lifestyle? What are the obligations resulting from participating?</strong>
        <p>Study participation is not expected to have any other impacts on your lifestyle. There are no future obligations associated with participating in the study. </p>

        <strong>How will the data collected in this study be used?</strong>
        <p>The personal data collected from you is the minimum relevant to the scope of the present study, and it will only be used for the specific, explicit and legitimate purposes for which they are obtained. Data on your actions during your participation will also be collected and used for research purposes. Once your data has been fully anonymized and cannot be linked back to you in any way, it will be analyzed and placed in an Open Data Repository to be shared with other researchers. 
            This will be done solely for research purposes and not for commercial use, in compliance with EU policy. Aggregated data may be shared to support reproducibility of published results. Personal data will not be used for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which the data were collected. Personal data will be stored on our servers until you lodge an objection or withdraw your consent. The data will not be transferred outside the EU. The personal data collected is not subject to automated decision-making, and not subject to profiling.</p>
        
        <strong>What are your rights regarding the processing of your personal data? </strong>
        <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your data for marketing purposes or purposes related to conducting quality and satisfaction surveys – as we are processing your data on the basis of legitimate interest; the right to object to the processing of your data on grounds of special circumstances – in cases where we process your data on the basis of our legitimate interest for purposes other than those set out in the item above, the right to request that your personal data be rectified; the right to request the erasure of your personal data, only if we are not obliged by law to process it, the rights to request that the processing of your personal data should be restricted; the right to have your data transferred, i.e. the right to receive your personal data from us – in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable computer format. You may transfer this data to another data controller on your own or request that we transfer your data to another controller. 
        However, we will only do this if such a transfer is feasible. Finally, you have the right to access your personal data. In order to exercise these rights, please contact the study coordinators at <a href="mailto:collectivemindslab@csh.ac.at">collectivemindslab@csh.ac.at</a>. </p>
        
        <strong>Will there be any costs for the participants? Will they receive reimbursement or remuneration? </strong>
        <p>There is no cost for taking part in the study. The study consists of three phases, where the first two 
            are completed individually, with no interaction with others. You will be compensated for the duration of the study 
            according to the standard hourly rate. Since the whole survey will take about 10 minutes, you will be compensated with 2.00 USD. If you become inactive or did not pass the attention check, you will not be compensated.</p>
