        <h5><strong>🚶‍➡️🚶🏻 Next Phase: Meeting with Neighbors</strong></h5>
         <p>📅 The next community meeting is scheduled for <strong>next week</strong>.
           In this next phase, imagine that you <strong>run into some neighbors by chance</strong>—imagine you're out for a walk and strike up a brief chat. You get   to <strong>talk about a dilemma that’s up for discussion in the upcoming village meeting</strong>. 
             
           <p>Together, you’ll <strong>share your opinion about the same dilemma</strong> and get to hear each other’s perspectives.</p>
        </p>

        <h5><strong>⚠️ Please note:</strong></strong></h5>

        <p>
            There may be a brief <strong>waiting period</strong> during the group matching process (between pages).
            <br>
            Because of this, we ask for your <strong>full commitment</strong> before proceeding.
            If you <strong>leave or become inactive</strong> during the next phase after committing, <strong>you will not receive any payment</strong>.
        </p>

        <h5><strong>✅ Participation Commitment</strong></strong></h5>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>If you do not wish to continue</strong>, select <em>“Disagree”</em> below. You will <strong>still receive compensation</strong> for earlier parts of the study.</li>
            <li><strong>If you agree to participate</strong>, confirm your commitment by selecting <em>“Agree”</em> to the following statements:</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        
        <p class="green-box">✅ On top of your base payment, you will receive an additional 2.00 USD after you complete the Phase 3 or a compensation of 0.60 USD if you waited for too long to be matched.</p>
