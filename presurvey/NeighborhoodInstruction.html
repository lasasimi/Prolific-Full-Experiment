    <p>🏘️ Imagine that <strong>you live in a village of around 50 houses owned by neighbors</strong> of different ages, occupations, and incomes. </p>
    <p>👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 In the village, people share spaces and responsibilities, and <strong>issues arise</strong> about how to make <strong>shared decisions</strong> in the best interest of the community and get along together.</p>
    <p>🏡 There are often different opinions on how to handle these issues. <strong>All neighbors meet as a community</strong> once every six months to discuss issues in the neighborhood to reach a decision. </p>
    
    <p>💭 We’d like to hear <strong>your initial opinions on the dilemma</strong> your neighborhood is facing.</p>
