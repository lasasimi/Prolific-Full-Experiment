    We will now show you a series of dilemmas experienced by your village. After each dilemma, we will ask you a few questions about each of them. 
    First, as you are a part of the village, we will ask what you think the community should do. You will be given several options to choose from. 
    Then, we will ask you other questions about some further aspects of the dilemmas.  
    <br><br>
    First, we will give you a short training session to familiarize you with the task. The next screen will show you an example of a dilemma and you can see how your neighbors responded to it. You will be given a chance to respond to the dilemma and then answer some questions about it to test your comprehension. <strong>You have two attempts to answer the questions correctly before proceeding to the main task.</strong>
